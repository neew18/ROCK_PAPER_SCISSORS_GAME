# ROCK_PAPER_SCISSORS_GAME

This program creates a rock-paper-scissors game which can be played by two players(one of them is not a bot).

The rules of the game are as follows:
-  rock beats scissors (the rock can break the scissors but the scissors can't cut the rock)
- paper beats rock (the paper can cover the rock)
- scissors beats paper (the scissors can cut the paper)

If the input from either player is invalid, they lose the round. If both players type in something else than rock, paper or scissors, the result is a tie.
